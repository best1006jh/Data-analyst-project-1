# Customer Experience Enhancement through Customer Service Data Analysis


# Project Overview
This project analyzes simulated LG Electronics customer service ticket data to diagnose issues in customer inquiries and propose strategies for improving service quality. The objective is to demonstrate the ability to leverage data analytics to address business challenges and drive actionable improvements.


# Project Structure
1. installation.py: Data loading and preprocessing module serving as a shared toolkit.
2. question1.py: Inquiry type analysis to identify the most frequent issues.
3. question2.py: Root cause analysis focusing on product defect inquiries by product category.
4. question3.py: Business impact assessment of inquiries in terms of time and resource consumption.
5. question4.py: Agent performance analysis measuring average handling time and customer satisfaction.


# Key Findings
1.  Product defects as the most critical issue
      – 35% of all inquiries were defect-related, significantly impacting customer satisfaction.
3. Concentration in refrigerator products
      – Nearly 60% of defect inquiries originated from the refrigerator line, indicating a need for targeted quality control.
5. Substantial hidden costs
      – Defect-related cases accounted for 41% of total service resources, imposing a considerable operational burden.


# Recommendations
- Short term:
     Implement a specialized support process for refrigerator defect cases, provide targeted training for agents, and optimize workload distribution.
- Long term:
     Share analysis results regularly with the Quality Assurance team to support systemic product improvements and reduce defect rates over time.
